The test was crashing in case javastics==NULL, (which is possible if not given to stics_wrapper_options when initializing model_options, for example).

* changes: manage Stics usms input files generation from a JavaStics workspace without using the JavaStics command line interface.

* merge with master

* man update

* useless lines & commented code

* man update

* Update check-standard.yaml

triggers actions on every branch

* fix: linting

* fixes: files names extraction in usms.xml, plant files and general parameters files location retrieving.
changes: gen_sol_xsl_file function in a new R file

* collate field update

* no doc for gen_sol_xsl

* added: checking now culturean value

* wrong use of unknown_idx and table update ahd to be after the warning

* fix : calculating culturean and nbans

* fix: culturean to 0, not to 1 as previously

* fix :  && for unique value

* fix: get usm data from usms.xml and extracting climatic year from files (col. separator)

* fix: codesimul in gen_new_travail
Improvement of files generation and copy in usm files generation

* Update CITATION.cff

* fix: for detecting files type

* Now using XML::free when possible through the xml_document class delete method

* using now an xml_doc loaded inside get_usms_list or get_soils_list and use for testing the doc type and with the find_usms_soils_names function

* get_usms_files kept (check_usms_files removed) and returns either a list or a data.frame.
gen_soil_xsl_file is using soil name.

many improvement on xml data manipulation, speed is hihly improved without using JavaSTICS cmd for files conversion

Some linting issues and functions help fixed.

* removed commented code line

* Merge main into plecharpent/feat/XML-transfo

* fix missing line after last arrow
