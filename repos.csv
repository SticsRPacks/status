* added TODO comments for fixing parameters values attached to layers.

* Checks have been added for controlling extraction/replacement operations on vectors

* For parameters vectors, the behaviour is to replace all values with the same if only one replacement value. Otherwise, for replacing a subset of values a vector of ids must be given with the new values vector (but not in case of full replacement)
